# combinator
R Package which contains combinators for functional programming in R. Mostly for learning. Perhaps as a set of tools to compose more complex data transformations.


## Possible features

1. Aliases for all combinators (e.g. Bluebird or B combinator `bluebird()` or `b()`. Maybe even special symbols which should be accessed via shortcuts in RStudio.
2. Print method for all combinators which shows an ASCII art style flow diagram of the combinator.
