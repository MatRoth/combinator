# combinator
R Package which contains combinators for functional programming in R.

The combinators are taken from the curated list of combinators from
https://github.com/loophp/combinator

## Possible features

1. Aliases for all combinators (e.g. Bluebird or B combinator `bluebird()` or `b()`.
2. Print method for all combinators which shows an ASCII art style flow diagram of the combinator.
3. (Optional for learning purposes) Type checking using the `typed` package. Checks if inputs for elements of the combinator are indeed functions.
